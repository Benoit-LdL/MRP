## What's this project about?

A few years ago I wanted to start learning ROS and I bought a small humanoid robot. The goal was to control it using ROS, but had underestimated how much work and how complex that would be.

## What's the goal of this project?

This  time I wanted to start a project from scratch AND make something that would be easier to program : a wheeled robot. Instead of the 10+ degrees of freedom I had to control with the humanoid, I only need to control 4 motors to do basic movements.
